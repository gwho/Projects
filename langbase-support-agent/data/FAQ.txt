=== TROUBLESHOOTING ===

Q: I forgot my password. How do I reset it?
A: Click "Forgot Password" on the login page, enter your email address, and we'll send you a password reset link. The link expires after 1 hour for security reasons.

Q: Why am I getting a "Session Expired" error?
A: This occurs when you've been inactive for more than 24 hours. Simply log in again to create a new session. You can enable "Keep me logged in" to extend sessions to 30 days.

Q: The app is running slowly. What should I do?
A: First, try clearing your browser cache or restarting the desktop app. If the issue persists, check if you have many browser extensions enabled (disable them temporarily). For desktop apps, ensure you're running the latest version from Settings > About.

Q: I can't upload files. What's wrong?
A: Common causes: 1) File exceeds size limit for your plan, 2) File type not supported (we support images, PDFs, Office docs, and text files), 3) Browser blocking file uploads (check permissions in browser settings).

Q: Error: "API rate limit exceeded"
A: This means you've made too many requests in a short time. Free tier: 100 requests/hour. Pro: 1000 requests/hour. Enterprise: 10,000 requests/hour. Wait a few minutes and try again, or upgrade your plan for higher limits.
